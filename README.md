# spotify wrapped
> turning my spotify data into a data visualization project

currently: 
- answering guiding questions 
todo: 
- change the column name for top 5 artists
- convert minutes to hours if time
- answer other questions
- fix data preprocessing so that it's more cohesive instead of scattered across the project

workflow
- data preprocessing/cleaning
    - songs only (basically removing outliers)
    - year 2023 (depending on guiding questions)
    - combine duplicate songs (not doing so affects the msPlayed data)
- data analysis
    - dropping, reordering columns, etc
    - potentially some regression models, etc
