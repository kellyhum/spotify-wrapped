# spotify wrapped
> turning my spotify data into a data visualization project

currently: 
- answering guiding questions 
todo: 
- do the deeper analysis questions

workflow
- data preprocessing
    - songs only (basically removing outliers)
    - year 2023 (depending on guiding questions)
    - combine duplicate songs (not doing so affects the msPlayed data)
- data analysis
    - dropping, reordering columns, etc
- data visualization
    - bar graphs
