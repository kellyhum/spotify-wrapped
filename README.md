# spotify wrapped
> turning my spotify data into a data visualization project

currently: answering guiding questions 
todo: change the column name for top 5 artists, convert minutes to hours if time, answer other questions

notes:
- data cleaning should also filter for songs only, drop podcasts
    - how do you distinguish between podcasts and songs?
- also should combine duplicate songs
